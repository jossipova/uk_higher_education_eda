## Introduction & Goal

Weâ€™ll explore how location, gender and opportunity interact in shaping UK graduate outcomes and uncover where the system rewards, and where it fails to deliver.

### Research questions
- How has the supply of UK graduates shifted over time?
- Does access to education translate into equality?
- Do graduates have to choose between stability and higher income?
- Do qualification levels affect the gender pay gap?

## Data source

## Key findings
- The system rewards education, but not equally.
- Women form the more stable workforce, yet the labour market rewards availability over commitment.
- Women now make up the majority of graduates, yet their growing presence in higher education has not translated into equal outcomes in pay.
